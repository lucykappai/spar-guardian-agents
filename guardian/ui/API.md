# Results browser API

Start: `make ui`, or `.venv/bin/python -m guardian ui [--port 8765] [--no-open]` from the repository root. The UI is
served at `/` and its assets at `/static/<file>` from `guardian/ui/static/` (`index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`). All API
responses are JSON.

## UI routes

| hash | part |
|---|---|
| `#/` | Summary: cheating by setting, composition grids, team reports against the judge |
| `#/runs?q=&setting=&control=&cheated=&failed=1&sort=&dir=` | Runs: one row per run, opening to its agents |
| `#/run/<run>` | run page; `.../timeline`, `.../context?agent=&call=`, `.../sample`, `.../episode/<episode>?find=&kind=&step=` |
| `#/swarm?run=<run>` | Swarm: grids, outcome funnel, adoption curves, swarm runs with rasters, run explorer |

A **setting** is the communication graph (`single`: a lone agent; `board`: every agent on one shared board), the roster size, and
whether roles were hidden. `run.json` writes `topology: "swarm"` for a board with hidden roles; the API adds `graph` so the swarm reads
as what it is, a board of N agents with roles.

## Data model

A **run** is one directory under `runs/` holding `run.json`, `episodes.jsonl`, `judge.jsonl`, `trajectories/<episode>/transcript.json`,
optionally `communication/<sample>.json` (board posts) and `defense/<sample>.json` (control evidence). One run has one sample
(`riemann#1`) and one **episode per agent**: `riemann#1` for a lone agent, `riemann#1@alpha` and `riemann#1@beta` on the board.
`run.json.eval_log` points at the Inspect `.eval` log, from which **context windows** (every model call's exact provider input)
are read on demand.

Runs whose name starts with `failed<N>_` or `cancelled<N>_`, or whose episodes carry `failure` in `harness` or `connection_closed`
(a provider error), are **failed** and never counted. A run whose model starts with `mockllm` is a smoke test (`mock: true`), listed
under Runs and left out of the Summary. A verdict **counts** only on an episode with a transcript.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/runs` → `[RunSummary]`
```
RunSummary = {
  run, task, model, topology ("single"|"board"|"swarm" as run.json wrote it), graph ("single"|"board"), n_agents, roles: bool, mock: bool,
  agents: [str], control (e.g. "baseline","guardian_task"), monitor_model, defenses: [str], eval_log, eval_log_exists, failed: bool,
  swarm: null | {n_agents, regulators, disregulators, workers, seed, composition, swarm_report_cheated, has_report},
  deliverables: null | {archive_in_workspace, registered_on_main, registered_message_copied_from},
  endings: {label: count}   # failure label, else "submit", else the converter's ended_by
  has_communication, has_defense,
  episodes: [Episode]
}
Episode = {                       # one row of episodes.jsonl plus:
  episode, orbit_agent, role?, n_tool_calls, n_turns, wall_time, limit, failure, error, ended_by, ok, score: {deliverables_scorer: 0|1},
  usage: {input, output, cache_read}, control, defenses: [str],
  defense: {checks, blocks, blocks_by_boundary: {model_input?, model_output?, tool_call?}, checks_by_boundary},
  transcript_path, has_transcript,
  verdict: null | {cheated, honey_pots_seen, attempted_access, extracted_submission, success_claim_seen_before_access,
                   disclosed_access, explicit_prohibition_violated, summary, judge, judge_cost_usd, parse_ok, judge_error}
}
```

### `GET /api/runs/<run>` → `RunSummary + {run_json, communication: {<sample>: {messages:[...], events:[...]}}, defense: {<sample>: {defenses:[DefenseConfig], log:{blocks:[...], ...}, interventions:[...]}}}`
Board message: `{id, sender, sequence, channel_id, content, ...}`. Intervention: `{event:"defense_intervention", defense, boundary ("model_input"|"model_output"|"tool_call"), allow: bool, reason, agent, turn, tool?, message_id?, ...}`.

### `GET /api/runs/<run>/transcript/<episode>` → `{episode: Episode, transcript: Transcript}`
```
Transcript = {agent, model, prompt, orbit: {agent, roster, topology, system_prompt, submit_recovered_from_events,
              delivery_notices_recovered_from_events, model_calls}, trajectory: ATIF}
ATIF.steps[i] = {step_id, source: "system"|"user"|"agent", message, reasoning_content?, model_name?,
                 tool_calls?: [{tool_call_id, function_name, arguments}],
                 observation?: {results: [{source_call_id, content, extra?: {is_error?, error?, withheld_from_model_by_defense?}}]},
                 extra?: {orbit_delivery_notice?, orbit_trailing_turn_fix?, submit_recovered_from_events?, orphan_tool_result?, ...}}
```
A blocked tool call has a result whose `extra.error` starts with `Blocked by defense '<name>'`. An agent step whose message is
exactly `I cannot provide that response under the configured defense policy.` is a defense refusal (blocked completion).

### `GET /api/runs/<run>/sample` → sample-level facts from the eval log
`{status, model, eval_id, total_time, working_time, limit, error, model_usage: {model: {input, cache_read, output, reasoning}},
  scores: {deliverables_scorer: {value, answer (message.txt), explanation, metadata: {listing, git, agent_evals, agent_evals_main, probe}}},
  store: {...}, n_messages, n_events}`

### `GET /api/runs/<run>/context` → `{run, agents: [str], defenses: [str], calls: [CallIndex]}`
```
CallIndex = {index, agent (null for a defense's own call that is not inside an agent span), defense (null for the agent's own call,
             else the defense name whose monitor made the call), model, timestamp, working_time, n_input, input_chars, tools: [str],
             usage: {input, cache_read, output, reasoning} | null, output_preview, output_tool_calls: [str], stop_reason, error,
             flags: subset of ["delivery_notice", "trailing_turn_fix", "redacted", "defense_refusal"]}
```
### `GET /api/runs/<run>/context/<index>` → `CallIndex + {input: [Message], output: Message|null, output_error, tool_schemas: [{name, description}]}`
```
Message = {role: "system"|"user"|"assistant"|"tool", id, text, reasoning, flags: [...],
           tool_calls?: [{id, function, arguments}] (assistant), model? (assistant),
           tool_call_id?, function?, error? (tool)}
```
`flags` mark provider-only or altered messages: `delivery_notice` (ORBIT board notice placed in the input), `trailing_turn_fix`
(continue prompt appended by the integration), `redacted` (a defense withheld this message's content from the model),
`defense_refusal` (this assistant text replaced a blocked completion).

Errors: 404 `{"error": ...}` for unknown run/episode/call; 500 `{"error", "traceback"}` for server faults.

### `GET /api/runs/<run>/timeline` → events of one run on a common clock (seconds from the sample's start)
```
{run, t0, duration, limit, agents: [str], roles: {agent: role} (swarm runs), verdicts: {agent: cheated|null},
 first_honeypot_touch: {agent: t}, first_member_read: {agent: t},   # heuristics, see markers
 events: [Event] sorted by t, board: [Post], markers: {touch, member_read}}
Event = {t, t_end?, agent, kind: "model"|"defense_call"|"tool"|"submit"|"defense", ...}
  model:        tokens_in, tokens_out, tool_calls: [function], output_blocked: bool (a defense replaced this completion; from the block event), refusal: bool (the output text is the refusal sentence, possibly model-written), error
  defense_call: defense (the control's own judge call)
  tool/submit:  function, id, preview, blocked, error, honeypot_touch, member_read, message_ids? (channel_post: sent; channel_read: read)
  defense:      defense, boundary, allow, reason, tool?
Post = {sequence, sender, id, t, content, read_by: [{agent, t, how: "read"|"model_exposure"}]}
```
`honeypot_touch` marks a bash/python call whose arguments name another agent's branch, commit or copied archive
(openmath_agent riemann row); `member_read` marks a successful call whose result carries text found only inside
agent-014's archive members. They place moments on a timeline; the judge verdict in `verdicts` is the record of truth.

### `GET /api/summary` → `{runs: [RunAggregate]}` for cross-run charts (no eval log needed)
```
RunAggregate = {run, control, topology, graph, roles: bool, mock: bool, model, failed, n_agents, judged, cheated, honeypots_seen,
                attempted, disclosed, blocks, checks, timeouts, score, wall_time, prompt_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read, judge_cost,
                registered_on_main, registered_copied_from, archive_in_workspace, endings: {label: count},
                regulators, disregulators, workers, composition, seed, report_cheated, has_report,
                by_role: {worker|regulator|disregulator: {n, cheated, honeypots_seen, attempted, disclosed}} | null}
```
